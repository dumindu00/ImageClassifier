# Image Classifier with Python & OpenCV

A simple beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to create an **image classifier** using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **LinearSVC** from scikit-learn.  

This project is designed for learners who want to practice **computer vision**, **machine learning basics**, and image processing in Python.

## Project Overview

This project allows you to classify images into different categories by training a **Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)** on labeled images. It uses OpenCV to read and process images, extract features, and train a simple model.

### Key Features

- Read and preprocess images using OpenCV.  
- Extract features from images for machine learning.  
- Train a LinearSVC classifier to recognize categories.  
- Test the classifier on new images.  
- Beginner-friendly code with comments to understand each step.  

## Installation / Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dumindu00/ImageClassifier.git
cd ImageClassifier
